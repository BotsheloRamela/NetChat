# About NetChat

The Java TCP client-server group chat app, NetChat, with encrypted messages is a simple yet effective solution for secure communication within a group. This project enables multiple clients to connect to a single server, allowing them to exchange messages with one another in real-time. The app incorporates encryption algorithms to ensure the confidentiality of messages being sent between the clients.

The application is built using Java Socket programming to establish a TCP connection between the server and clients. The chat messages are encrypted using symmetric encryption techniques such as AES or DES before being sent over the network.

The group chat app has an intuitive and user-friendly interface that allows users to send and receive messages seamlessly. The app also includes features like creating and joining chat rooms, sending private messages, and receiving notifications. The application can be easily customized to suit the needs of different organizations and groups.

Overall, the Java TCP client-server group chat app with encrypted messages is an excellent choice for organizations or groups that require secure communication channels. It provides a convenient and reliable way for users to communicate and collaborate, ensuring that their messages remain private and secure.
